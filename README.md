## Summary

The visualizations show that the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August is quite busy. The majority of rides occur from Monday to Friday, which might be an indicator that most of the users commute to work using the bike sharing service. This is also demonstrated because the the busiest time is rush hour. 
Perhaps the Citi bike service is used as an alternative to public transportation (metro, bus or taxi). It would be interesting to see what the trend is during winter time to see how it varies given weather conditions.
I'd also be interested to know if the type of customers varies during the year. For example, if during high touristic months there are more short-term customers.
